# Pokémon GO Search Tool

## Overview

The **Pokémon GO Search Tool** is a React-based web application designed to streamline the process of refining and cleaning out Pokémon storage in the Pokémon GO mobile game. With the ever-growing number of Pokémon species, players often find it challenging to efficiently manage their collection. This tool generates advanced search strings that can be copied and pasted directly into the Pokémon GO search bar, enabling players to filter and identify specific Pokémon for transferring, tagging, or powering up.

By automating this process, the Pokémon GO Search Tool helps players save time, avoid manual errors, and optimize their Pokémon storage with ease.
